Selenium WebDriver is a collection of open source APIs(we don't need to buy it) which are used to automate the testing of a web application.
  Use: To automate web application testing to verify that it works as expected.
It supports many browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari.

Advantage:
-open source
-OS independent
-supports multiple languages (Ruby, java, c#, Python)
-works with multiple different browsers

Disadvantage of selenium webdriver:
```````````````````````````````````
-It supports Web based applications only (cannot test desktop applications).
-No reliable Technical Support from anybody.
-Limited support for image testing (cannot verify images)
-Does not have inbuilt reporting feature
-cannot test CAPTCHA/Barcodes
  **CAPTCHA is a system or program that distinguishes human and machine input (to prevent spammers from using bots to generate hundreds of spam mail accounts)
-No official guideline for how to use Selenium
-Difficult to use, takes more time to create Test cases.
-Difficult to Setup Test Environment when it compares to Vendor Tools like UFT, RFT, SilkTest etc.
